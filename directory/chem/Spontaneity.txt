Remember: the more negative Gibbs is, the more spontaneous.

G = h-TS

If the reaction is exothermic, deltaH is negative. 
If the change in entropy is positive, entropy increases, then it depends. Lower temp. Spontaneous.

If exothermic and entropy up, spontaneous.

If endothermic and s positive, need to decrease s term by raise temp.


If endothermic and s negative, not Spontaneous. Proceeds only if you put in energy. Needs energy to start.
