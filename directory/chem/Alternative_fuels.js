Ethanol by fermentation. Of biomass. O2 atom ensures complete combustion., but partial oxygenation reduces Energon capacity

Methane: renewable, from bacterial digestion of agricultural wastes. Environment::oxygen absent::. Formula// CH4. To increase rate of generation on a large scale, <sugar> added.
**less useful than ethanol, as a gas, has low enthalpy density (enthalpy of combustion per Liter).
Use:: capable wherever natural gas in used

Biodiesel: alias for diesel fuel from algae or vegetable oil. Context('renewable organic sources');
@includes: used oils, from fryers. 
::More efficient than gasoline engines. 
::high energy density (enthalpy of combustion per Liter)
(<>)however, it is more viscous and may solidify at lower temperatures

Substances contribute to greenhouse effect, produce co2 when burned. But plants can renew energy.
The Sun replenishes the energy.
