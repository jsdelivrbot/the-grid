//vast reserves of petroleum
//petroleum: source of liquid hydrocarbon fuels
//hydrocarbon fuels: gasoline, coal

//this.reserves are limited && irreplaceable 

//alternative and sustainable power generation methods

//hydroelectric power
//wind power
//geothermal power
//solar power
//alternative fuels

//::purpose:: reduce demand for fossil fuels

//hydrogen, ethanol, methane, biodiesel

//hydrogen extracted from ocean water by electrolysis
// or...
// steam reforming of hydrocarbons
// ch4,g + h20,g --> co,g + 3h2,g 
//co,g + h20,g --> co2,g + h2,g

// most of hydrogen production relies on hydrocarbons in:
//petroleum
//coal
