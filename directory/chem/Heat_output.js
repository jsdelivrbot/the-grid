Enthalpy density = enthalpy of combustion per Liter
::account for burden of mass: specific enthalpy. kJ per gram


//Guide:

Fuels already oxygenated have lower enthalpy densities

//Given:
Enthalpy of combustion( 1 mol)
Joules of heat needed

Can calculate: 
Mols needed

Molar mass

Can calculate: mass needed
