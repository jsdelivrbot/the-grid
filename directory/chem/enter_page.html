superheating/cooling: falls below point.

Hess's law: cancel out everything except products and reactants.

<font color="blue">Hess's law: overall reaction enthalpy is the sum of reaction enthalpies of steps into which the reaction can be divided.</font>

<div class="deltaH">
Standard enthalpies of formation: formation of substance in their most stable form
</div>

<div>
<b>note: the standard enthalpy of formation of an Element in its most stable form: 0</b>
<p>
Standard Enthalpy of formation of C(gr), graphite, is 0.  Graphite --> graphite is a null reaction. Nothing changes. 
<font color="red" > Most stable form: already formed. </font>
<p> However, the conversion of carbon to graphite is Nonzero.
C(gr) --> c(diamond) deltaH = +1.9 kJ
Diamond is not carbon graphite's stable form.
<div>
<button>Aww yeah!</button>
First, we convert reactants-->elements in stable form. C(diamond)-->c(graphite). 
<p>
And then, elements--> <font color="#33ccff" >products </font>
</div>

</div>

<div>
At first, we need to calculate. Formation of products. Then calculate formation of reactants from elements.
<p>
The difference: moles enthalpy formation Products - moles enthalpy formation reactants = enthalpy formation of Reaction

Example 
</font>
Amino acids are building blocks. They are oxidized ( lose electrons) into urea, co2, and h20(l).  
<p>
Find oxidation of an amino acid, glycine.  NH2 CH2 COOH. 

2 mols glycine + 3 mols O2 gas --> urea H2N-CO-NH2  + 3 mols co2 + 3 mols h2o
<p>
Pro tip: this is a combustion, since oxygen is used. Combustion a release heat. Exothermic, so enthalpy should be negative.

<p>
So we find enthalpy formation of products.
P.295
Urea: CO (nh2) 2(s). -632 kJ per mol
Co2:
H2o:

enthalpy of formation of Reactants
Glycine: -969 kJ per mol
O2: 0. It's in its most stable form.
