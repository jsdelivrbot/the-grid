2ND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS 

Delta_S = q rev /T

q must be transferred reversibly.
The infinitestessimal of differences causes changes

Context. Temperature 
T system = constant=t surr.

Heat = J, T = Kelvin.   Delta_S = J/K

Low T causes high change, high increase in entropy, thermal motion. Sneezing in a quiet library attracts attention.


Kelvin= 273.15+ 25 = 298 K
Delta_S = 100.j/ 298 K
0.336 J/ K

//convert to kelvin. It's not change in energy



::Heating causes thermal disorder
Positional disorder: dispersion, mixing

dS = dqrev /T
dqrev = C.heat capacity *dT

dS = C heat capacity dT/ T

deltaS = integral t1-t2 dS 

deltaS = C heat capacity ln(T2/T1) DIVISION

Greater the ratio of temp, the greater the entropy. Graphical: delta_S/C increases at an almost infinitesimal rate initially, then rate of change flattens out, vs. T1/T2


Thermal disorder

//given: 
20.0L nitrogen gas, 5.00kPa, from 20 degrees to 400. degrees Celsius, constant volume.
Delta_S of nitrogen?

Molar heat capacity of Nitrogen and constant volume: Cvm: 20 .81 J/K*mol

Delta_S = C heat capacity ln(T2/T1) 


Temperature to kelvin:
T2 400+273.15 K 673 K
T1 20+ 273.15 K 293 K

673 K/273 K

Find mols of Nitrogen.  PV = nRT # USE PV = NRT TO FIND MOLS
n= PV/RT
T = T1
n = 5.00kPa*20.0L/(8.314 L kPa/mol K * 293 K)

Delta_S= n*Cvm * ln(T2/T1)




::Some changes are accompanied by a change in volume

Larger volume, larger range of locations, entropy increases with volume.
T

T is constant, so delta_S = qRev/T

deltaU = q+ w
deltaU = 0 for isothermal expansion.  
so q = -w

extrapolation::

qRev=-wRev

wRev=-nRT ln(V2/V1)

deltaS = deltaQRev/T

-wRev/T

nRTln(V2/V1)/T = nRln(V2/V1)

when delta V2 is positive, entropy increase



Isothermal compression: deltaS = nRln(P1/P2)

Pressure inversely related to volume. ::How do we find a reversible path?



To calculate entropy, find a reversible path between final and initial states.  Entropy is a state function.







Entropy of vaporization::delta_S vaporization = deltaH vapor atom / T boiling

Standard entropy of vaporization: near 85 J/K Mol

Trouton's rule

Increase in positional disorder occurs.



Fusion: freezing, melting


Delta_S = deltaH enthalpy fusion/ T freezing



::Third Law of Thermodynamics

Standard molar entropies

Standard Reaction entropies


Total entropy change: change of system + change of surroundings

Delta_S surroundings = -deltaH /T  Constant temperature and pressure



Clausius inequality:: 

read p.344

Entropy can't decrease in an isolated system


Equilibrium p. 346-347



::Gibbs free energy

State function:

Delta_S total= delta_S sys -deltaH/T
constant temperature and pressure

G= H -TS 

Delta_G/T = deltaH/T -deltaS


delta_G = -T delta_S tot


At constant pressure and temperature, spontaneous change comes with decreasing Gibbs free energy


provided that temperature and pressure are constant, we can predict spontaneity of the process solely in terms of the thermodynamic properties of the system

Equilibrium:

Delta_G = 0 at constant temperature and pressure
