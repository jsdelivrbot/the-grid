2ND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS 

Delta_S = q rev /T

q must be transferred reversibly.
The infinitestessimal of differences causes changes

Context. Temperature 
T system = constant=t surr.

Heat = J, T = Kelvin.   Delta_S = J/K

Low T causes high change, high increase in entropy, thermal motion. Sneezing in a quiet library attracts attention.


Kelvin= 273.15+ 25 = 298 K
Delta_S = 100.j/ 298 K
0.336 J/ K

//convert to kelvin. It's not change in energy



::Heating causes thermal disorder
Positional disorder: dispersion, mixing

dS = dqrev /T
dqrev = C.heat capacity *dT

dS = C heat capacity dT/ T

deltaS = integral t1-t2 dS 

deltaS = C heat capacity ln(T2/T1) DIVISION

Greater the ratio of temp, the greater the entropy. Graphical: delta_S/C increases at an almost infinitesimal rate initially, then rate of change flattens out, vs. T1/T2


Thermal disorder

//given: 
20.0L nitrogen gas, 5.00kPa, from 20 degrees to 400. degrees Celsius, constant volume.
Delta_S of nitrogen?

Molar heat capacity of Nitrogen and constant volume: Cvm: 20 .81 J/K*mol

Delta_S = C heat capacity ln(T2/T1) 


Temperature to kelvin:
T2 400+273.15 K 673 K
T1 20+ 273.15 K 293 K

673 K/273 K

Find mols of Nitrogen.  PV = nRT # USE PV = NRT TO FIND MOLS
n= PV/RT
T = T1
n = 5.00kPa*20.0L/(8.314 L kPa/mol K * 293 K)

Delta_S= n*Cvm * ln(T2/T1)




::Some changes are accompanied by a change in volume
